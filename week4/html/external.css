	- Element selector
	- Id selector
	- class selector

/* 
	The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
	An id should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used if you want to select a single, unique element.
	To select an element with a specific id, write a hash character, followed by the id of the element.
