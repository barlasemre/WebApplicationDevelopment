You are to create a simple library catalog. User should be able to add books and list them all. It should include 2 pages.

- A form that will add a new book
- A page that will display all books stored in library database

* User should be able to enter these data into the form:
- Book Name
- Author (Assume that there is only one author per book)
- ISBN
- Price (in TL)
* Form should insert the book data into a database. Form data should be validated in backend code. 
Any database implementation can be used (any RDBMS or NoSQL databases)
* The list of books should fetch the data from the database and list them. After fetching the data, 
it must be cached by using the @Cachable annotation. Duration of the cache (TTL - Time To Live) should be 10 minutes.
* Extra points if you can invalidate the cache when a new book is added

- Spring MVC must be used
- All HTML must be well formed! You can validate your HTML on this page: http://validator.w3.org/
- It is up to you to use CSS or Javascript. If you do, there is no restrictions on them 
(that means you can use Bootstrap).
- JUnit test cases must be written
- Provide a README file that briefly describes your work.
- Email your project to yusuf.soysal@n11.com. It would better if you store them on GitHub/BitBucket 
in your personal repository.

Grading:
- HTMLâ€™s are valid and displayed as they should (10)
- Data is inserted to the database (20)
- Data is fetched from the database (20)
- Data is cached for 10 minutes (20)
- Cache is evicted when a new book is added (10)
- Form data is validated (10)
- Unit test cases are written and make sense. Code coverage percentage is important (15)
- README is provided with enough description that tells what you did (5)
